Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
it is the designing, developing testing and maintaining of software projects to ensure they are reliable, efficient and scallable. 
ensure creation of high quality software that canhandle complex tasks, business operations and gooduser experience

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
the birth of high level programming like cobol
introduction of structured programing fr reduced errors and high maintainability
rice of oop for code reusability, inheritance, classes and objects

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
requirements gathering
analysis - data is analysed to prioritize features and ensure the system will solve the required problems
design the system using figma, adobe XD etc to produce highlevel abstraction of the system
development by use of IDEs such as VS code to make the software
Testing the features of the system to ensure to ensure it works as desired by the customer
Maintenace the software is maintained through bug fixes, updates to accommodate emerging requirements etc


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
waterfall model is suitable for requirements that are well understood and do not change overtime. the stages are done once before proceeding to the next one and never back and forth. it is suitable for smaller projects

Agile is essential for large and complex projects that have evolving requirements whicg make the stages to be repeated over and over again. It is highly adaptive tochanges and doesn'trely much ondocumentation

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer
Role: Writes and maintains code.

Responsibilities: Implementing features, fixing bugs, and ensuring the software functions as intended.

Quality Assurance Engineer
Role: Ensures the quality of the software.

Responsibilities: Testing the software, identifying defects, and verifying that the software meets quality standards.

Project Manager
Role: Oversees the project.

Responsibilities: Managing timelines, resources, and communication among team members to ensure the project stays on track.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

IDEs such as VS code and Sublime Text provide essential tools used in development of a software such as deboggers, lnguage support, predictions, code editttign etc to make coding easier
VCs such as Git and Github manage changes in code , allow for collboration, deployment etc

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
software engineering projects can be complicated hence hard to manage and undestand... breakking down project to sprints will help
maintainig quality is a big challenge. Carryingout regular testing and rigorous , performing best practices etc

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Types of Testing in Software Quality Assurance
Unit Testing

Definition: Testing individual components or units of code to ensure they work as intended.

Importance: Helps identify and fix bugs early in the development process, ensuring that each part of the software functions correctly in isolation.

Integration Testing
Testing the interaction between integrated units or components to ensure they work together as expected.
Detects issues that arise from the interaction between different parts of the software, ensuring that integrated components function correctly as a whole.

System Testing
is Testing the complete and integrated software system to verify that it meets the specified requirements.
Ensures that the entire system works as intended, covering both functional and non-functional requirements.

Acceptance Testing
Testing the software to ensure it meets user requirements and is ready for deployment.
Validates that the software meets the needs of the end-users and stakeholders, ensuring it is fit for purpose before release.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
isthe process by which human can  craft precise and effective prompts to interact with AI models to ensre they get better versions of responses

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective
Vague Prompt: "Tell me about AI."

Improved Prompt: "Explain the key concepts of artificial intelligence, including machine learning, neural networks, and natural language processing, and discuss their applications in real-world scenarios."
